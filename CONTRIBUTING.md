## **Project Structure**
1. **`MountainCar/`**:  
   - **`MountainCar.py`**: Script for rendering the trained agent and observing its performance.
   - **`MountainCarAlgorithm.py`**: Core Q-learning algorithm for training the agent.
   - **`Visualize_q_table.py`**: Scripts to visualize training metrics and analyze the Q-table.
2. **`ModelData/`**:  
   - Contains the pre-trained Q-table (`q_table.pkl`) and training metrics (`training_metrics.pkl`).
   - If you prefer, you can run `MountainCar/MountainCarAlgorithm.py` to generate your own Q-table and metrics.
